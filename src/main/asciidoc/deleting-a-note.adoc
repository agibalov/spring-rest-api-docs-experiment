== Deleting a note

To delete a note, use the following request:

include::{snippets}/delete-note/success/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/get-note/success/path-parameters.adoc[]

Assuming that the note exists, the response will be:

include::{snippets}/delete-note/success/http-response.adoc[]

If it appears that note doesn't exist, you'll get a response like this:

include::{snippets}/delete-note/not-found/http-response.adoc[]
