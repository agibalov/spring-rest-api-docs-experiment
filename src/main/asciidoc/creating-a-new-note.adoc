== Creating a new note

To create a new note, use the following request:

include::{snippets}/post-note/success/http-request.adoc[]

Assuming that note has been created, the response will be:

include::{snippets}/post-note/success/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/post-note/success/response-headers.adoc[]

If you don't provide the valid field values, like this:

include::{snippets}/post-note/bad-request-validation/http-request.adoc[]

you'll get a response like this:

include::{snippets}/post-note/bad-request-validation/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/post-note/bad-request-validation/response-fields.adoc[]
