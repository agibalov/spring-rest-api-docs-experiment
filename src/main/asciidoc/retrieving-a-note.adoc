== Retrieving a note

To retrieve a note, use the following request:

include::{snippets}/get-note/success/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/get-note/success/path-parameters.adoc[]

Assuming that the note exists, the response will be:

include::{snippets}/get-note/success/http-response.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/get-note/success/response-fields.adoc[]

If it appears that requested note doesn't exist, you'll get a response like this:

include::{snippets}/get-note/not-found/http-response.adoc[]
